                    <p>It is possible to capitalize <span class="caps">any bit of a sentence you wish</span>. You may also capitalize <span class="caps">individual</span> words, though we're <span class="caps">not</span> sure why you <span class="caps">would</span>, as capitalized letters are generally considered <span class="caps">obnoxious</span>.</p>
                    <p class="caps">You may also capitalize entire sentences, which should excite the lawyers amongst you, for whom dense legal disclaimers are a source of constant enjoyment. Be ye warned, hitherto we are not liable for anything whateversoever therefore, the signing of which this document shall embond you to servitude without terminus, the completion of which quid pro quo dominus.</p>
                    <p>Be judicious in your application of this style!</p>
