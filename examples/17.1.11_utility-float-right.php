                    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>

                    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>

                    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
                    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>

                    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
                    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
                    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
