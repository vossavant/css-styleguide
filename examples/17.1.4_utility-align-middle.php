                    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
                    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
                    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
                    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
                    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
                    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
                    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
                    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
                    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
                    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
                    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
                    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
                    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
                    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
