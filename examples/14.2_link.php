                    <h3>Water may still flow on the surface of Mars today</h3>
                    <p>At least some water likely still flows on the surface of Mars, a new study suggests.</p>
                    <p>New data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter lends more evidence to the theory that <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/02/11/nasa-photo-water-mars" title="Provide tooltips when the link requires more context">extremely salty brines flow on Mars seasonally</a>, likely creating those dark streaks on Martian slopes</a> that the spacecraft has observed. This new finding could also have some broad implications for extinct and perhaps current life on Mars.</p>
                    <p>This discovery may solve a long-running mystery about the creation of the dark, thin streaks (called recurring slope lineae) that appear during warmer Martian months and fade during cool seasons. Basically, the new data lends more credence to the long-running hypothesis that, at least sometimes, a small amount of water flows down slopes on Mars.</p>
                    <p>"Under certain circumstances <a href="#" title="Dummy link that goes nowhere">liquid water might be found on Mars</a>," NASA's division of planetary science director Jim Green said during a press conference about the findings Monday.</p>
